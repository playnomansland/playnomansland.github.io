// Accounts (step 5). See docs/SERVER.md, "Accounts".
//
// Players start as guests: POST /account/guest gives a random player id, a gamertag and a session. "Sign in with
// Google" links a Google account to the player (or finds the player it was linked to before, on any phone). The
// player id is ours; Google's subject id is only a key to it. We never store passwords, emails or names from Google.
//
// Storage: the D1 database bound as ACCOUNTS. Without that binding every account route answers 503 'accounts off',
// so the server runs exactly as before until the database exists. Without GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID only Google sign-in is off.
//
// Sessions: a random 32-byte token the phone keeps; we store only its SHA-256. A session lasts SESSION_DAYS from its
// last rotation; once it is older than ROTATE_MS, the next /account/me hands out a new token and the old one keeps
// working for GRACE_MS (in case the answer never reached the phone). Tokens travel only in the Authorization header,
// never in a URL, and are never logged.
//
// Routes (all POST with a JSON body, origin-checked, rate limited per IP):
//   /account/guest   { tag? }            -> { player, session }
//   /account/me      (auth)              -> { player, session? (only when rotated) }
//   /account/google  { credential } (auth optional) -> { player, session, linked: 'new'|'guest'|'existing' }
//   /account/tag     { tag } (auth)      -> { player }  (once a week, developers any time: 429 'too soon' { next })
//   /account/signout { all? } (auth)     -> { ok }
//   /account/delete  (auth)              -> { ok }  (login, sessions and gamertag removed; the id stays as a tombstone)
//   /account/title   { title } (auth)   -> { player }  (shows one of the player's titles under the gamertag; '' = none)
//   /account/ranked  { on } (auth, developer only) -> { on }  (switches ranked play on or off for everyone)
//   /account/skin    { skin, worn } (auth) -> { player }  (wear or take off a skin the player owns; see SKINS below)
//   /account/invite  (auth, Google accounts) -> { code, friends, rewarded }  (this player's invite link; see INVITE below)
//   /account/discord { code, redirect } (auth) -> { player }  (Discord check for the BABABABA title; see DISCORD below)
//   /account/puzzle  { k, army } (auth)  -> { player, won, solved }  (a tutorial puzzle's fight, replayed here; see PUZZLE below)
//   /account/bug     { text, version, match, info } (auth optional) -> { ok, url }  (a post in #bug-reports; see BUG below)
//   /account/music   { music: { prefs, playlists } } (auth) -> { music }  (the music player's settings and the player's own
//                    playlists, kept on the account; see MUSIC below. playerOut carries it as player.music, null = never saved)
//   /account/friends, /account/friend/{add,accept,decline,cancel,remove,mute}, /account/dm/{list,read,report} (auth, Google
//                    accounts): friends and private messages; see FRIENDS below and hub.js (the live part)
// guest, google and me also take { invite: CODE }: a new account made through a friend's invite link (INVITE).
//
// Month end (2026-11-03): the Worker's hourly cron (wrangler.toml [triggers], index.js scheduled) calls awardLegends,
// which gives the top LEGEND.top of the leaderboard the gold Legend title once a month has ended (Stockholm time).
//
// Ranked play (2026-11-02): a ranked friend's match is a best of 3 refereed by the Room (room.js). When a series is
// decided the Room calls recordSeries, which adds a win, tie or loss to each player's row in 'ranked'. GET /leaderboard
// (index.js -> leaderboard) reads it. Players need an account (a guest is enough) to play ranked: the phone sends its
// session in the match's hello message (never in the URL) and the Room checks it with sessionPlayer.
